# Paradox File Utils
This is just a place for different tools and utilities I'm currently working on for my Quieter Events mod. If this gets much larger I may actually move this to a different repo just for maintainabilities sake.

## What's Here

### Vanilla Synchronizer

A tool for Crusader Kings III (or possibly other paradox games) modders to easily synchronize and update modded files with the latest vanilla game (script) files, while preserving changes to top-level entities and their comments.

More detail in it's [README.md](vanilla-synchronizer/README.md)

### Paradox File Parser

A tcode parser I generated using ANTLR that is able to parser most Paradox `.txt` files and allows more complex manipulation of entities in those files.

More detail in vanilla-synchronizer [README.md](vanilla-synchronizer/README.md#parser-information)

## Other Paradox Projects

### CK3 Quieter Events Mod
This mod is a successor to the **Less Event Spam** mod. It converts several vanilla events that took up the whole screen or required interaction for no reason into smaller toasts or messages.
