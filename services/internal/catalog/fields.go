// fieldKindCoverage is the share of a field's values that must resolve to the
// kind before the field is typed as it.
//
// Unanimity alone is not evidence: values that resolve to nothing were skipped,
// so one coincidental hit typed the field and every other use of it then became
// a reference of that kind which could never resolve. Measured on vanilla,
// `has_cultural_parameter` was typed `ep_3` on 1 of 432 values,
// `remove_variable` was typed `achievements` on 2 of 392, and `has_game_rule`
// was typed `modifiers` on 4 of 212 — between them the largest source of false
// "dangling reference" rows in Workspace Health.
//
// The distribution is strongly bimodal, so the exact threshold is not delicate:
// CK3 types 861 fields of which 632 sit at ≥90% coverage and 18 below 5%; Vic3
// types 357 with 194 at ≥90%. Half is the honest reading of "most of what this
// field holds is a thing of that kind".
const fieldKindCoverage = 50

// minFieldHits is how many of a field's values must resolve before the field is
// typed at all. Coverage is a ratio, and a ratio with no floor lets a single
// coincidence decide: `body_part` takes exactly two values across all of CK3,
// `head` and `torso`, and `head` also happens to name an artifact visual — so
// 1 of 2 cleared 50% exactly and every `body_part = torso` in the corpus became
// a dangling `visuals` reference, 859 of them on one mod.
//
// Measured on the three installs, fields typed on a single hit are junk without
// exception: `SIEGE_MESSAGE_ALIGNMENT` and `@zoom_step_far` as EU5
// locators_override, `clothes` as a CK3 animation, `0.25` as a Vic3
// trigger_localization. There are 240 such fields on CK3, 54 on Vic3 and 2,717
// on EU5. Two hits is where real typings start — `has_active_building` →
// buildings, `has_court_language` → pillars — so that is the floor.
//
// Same rule as minOptionRefs in options.go, which exists because a long tail of
// one-hit owners let a GUI property become a database.
