// sweep_test.go is the engine scoreboard: every Workspace Health check run
// against every workshop mod on this machine, so "the engine got better" is a
// number rather than a feeling.
//
// It is deliberately excluded from `task test` and `task test:full` — it walks
// three installs and 31 mods. Run it with `task test:sweep` when judging engine
// quality.
//
// The counts are NOT targets to drive to zero. Workshop mods go stale, and a mod
// referencing something a patch removed produces a correct finding. Rows are
// classified against testdata/health-baseline.json: a row listed there is a
// known-genuine defect with a stated reason, and anything else is a candidate
// false positive to investigate. To call a row false you must be able to point
// at where the thing IS defined, or name the engine mechanism that consumes it
// without a citation — a row nobody can explain is a candidate TRUE positive and
// gets baselined, never filtered away.
