# FAQ

## Is there a Mac build?

**No.** macOS is not supported. Windows and Linux (amd64 desktop distros) only. See [getting started]({{< relref "/getting-started" >}}).

## The language strip never says the session is ready

Vanilla scan of a full install takes time the first time. Leave the window open. If it stays empty: the install path is wrong or marked broken, or the version pin does not match files on disk. Fix the install in [Workspace Settings]({{< relref "/pages/settings" >}}), or use `latest` and reopen.

Two workspaces sharing one install share the vanilla **script** cache. Switching default loc language loads another loc sidecar; it should not rescan every `.txt`.

## I changed vanilla / subscribed a Workshop item and PMT looks stale

- **Vanilla:** change the version pin or trigger a rescan of that install (Settings). Live sessions on that install hot-swap the cache without restarting the app.
- **Mods:** harvest is RAM-only. Close and reopen the workspace (or switch away and back) after adding files outside the IDE.
- Attach a new folder in Settings or the wizard after you subscribe on Workshop.

## Localization is “ignored” in-game

Almost always one of: missing **UTF-8 BOM**, filename not `*_l_<lang>.yml`, first line not `l_<lang>:`, folder spelled `localisation`, or an override sitting outside `replace/`. See [localization]({{< relref "/concepts/localization" >}}). The IDE diagnostics flag BOM/header problems on **mod** files.

## Workshop item stays private / upload fails

New Steam items stay **private** until you set them Public on the Workshop website. Steam client must be running and signed in as the owner. Linux Workshop is amd64 only. Windows ARM uses the amd64 helper under emulation. See [Publish]({{< relref "/pages/publish" >}}).

## Why did the other workspace’s graph go blank?

Only **one** workspace is live. Opening another drops the previous session. That is [intentional for this alpha]({{< relref "/limitations" >}}).

## What does `# pmt:ignore` do?

It suppresses IDE diagnostics on that line or the next (`# pmt:ignore-next-line`). Optional codes limit which warnings. The game still loads the file as written.

## How do I check a game update?

Pin or keep `latest`, rescan the install, reopen the workspace, and read [Workspace Health]({{< relref "/pages/health" >}}) (dangling + overlays). [Patch Center]({{< relref "/pages/patch-center" >}}) has the wiki notes for that version. Suggested file-level retarget is on the [roadmap]({{< relref "/roadmap" >}}).

## SmartScreen / my antivirus blocked the zip

The Windows zip is **unsigned**. That is expected. Prefer the GitHub Release asset and the in-app updater (checksums via `SHA256SUMS`).

## Can I run two copies of the same mod (local + Workshop)?

Do not. The game will load both. Detach or unsubscribe one.

## Check for updates says it cannot verify

The footer version button needs a Release that includes both the platform zip **and** a sibling `SHA256SUMS`.
