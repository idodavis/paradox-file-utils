# Paradox Modding Tools

{{< img src="assets/banner.png" class="pmt-banner" alt="Paradox Modding Tools — Alpha · CK3 · Vic3 · EU5" >}}

A desktop workspace for **Crusader Kings III**, **Victoria 3**, and **Europa Universalis V** (partial) modders. One workspace is one game install plus the mods you are editing. From there you get a script-aware IDE, an event graph, compatibility and localization health, wiki patch notes, and a Steam Workshop / Paradox Mods publish flow.

PMT is **unofficial** and not affiliated with Paradox Interactive. Licensed [GPL-3.0-or-later](https://github.com/idodavis/paradox-modding-tools/blob/master/LICENSE).

{{< callout warning >}}
This is **alpha** software. Expect bugs and incomplete game coverage. Back up your mods.
