# Create Workspace

The wizard is how you add a workspace. You can change every choice later in [Workspace Settings]({{< relref "/pages/settings" >}}).

Walk through **game → install → mods → name**.

## Game

CK3, Vic3, or EU5. EU5 is [partial]({{< relref "/games/eu5" >}}).

## Install

Detect a known Steam/Paradox path or **Add** a folder. Multiple installs per game are allowed (beta vs live, different drives).

- **Version pin** — read from `launcher/launcher-settings.json`, or set `latest` to follow the live folder.
- A broken path is marked; you can fix it later without deleting the workspace.
- Changing install later rebuilds language intelligence for that install.

## Mods

- **Add existing** — any folder (Documents `mod/`, Workshop content, a git clone).
- **Create new mod** — descriptor (CK3 `.mod` + `descriptor.mod`; Vic3/EU5 `.metadata/metadata.json`), empty `common/` and `events/` (EU5: under the stage folders), readmes, localization stub **with UTF-8 BOM**.
- **Drag** to set load order (`SortOrder`). Same order as Settings and Health.

You do not have to attach every Workshop item — only what you are editing or depending on.

## Name

Display name in the Library and title bar. After create you land in the [IDE]({{< relref "/pages/ide" >}}) so you can open the files you just attached.

**Back** from the IDE returns to the Library, not to this wizard.
