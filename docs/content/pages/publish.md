# Publish

Edit the listing in the **mod folder** and publish to Steam Workshop or copy text for Paradox Mods.

The window title is **Publish**; the route name is `release`.

## What PMT writes

In the attached mod:

- Descriptor (CK3 `.mod` / `descriptor.mod`, or Vic3/EU5 `.metadata/metadata.json`)
- `mod-description.md` and `mod-description.bbcode` (paths overridable in Settings)
- `changelog/<version>.bbcode`

Description is Markdown in a rich editor. **Save** writes the Markdown file and converts to BBCode. Steam **always** uploads BBCode.

## Steam Workshop

{{< shot caption="Steam publish pane." >}}

- The Steam **client** must be running and signed in as the Workshop **owner**.
- The helper (`pmt-steamugc` + `steam_api*`) is **embedded** in the app and extracted to PMT’s user-config `bin/` at runtime.
- Staging skips dotfiles (except `.metadata/`), `.gitignore`, patterns in `.gitignore`, and Workshop ignore patterns from [Settings]({{< relref "/pages/settings" >}}).
- **New items stay private** until you set them Public on Workshop yourself.
- Do not run a local copy and a Workshop subscribe of the **same** mod together — the game will see both.

Linux Workshop builds are **amd64** only (Steamworks ships `linux64`). Windows ARM still embeds the **amd64** helper and runs it under x64 emulation.

## Paradox Mods

**Copy BBCode** for the launcher, or **Copy Markdown**. The site often strips formatting. The launcher still needs its own `.mod` / playset entry the way you already create mods.
