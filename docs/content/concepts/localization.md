# Localization

Player-facing text is YAML under `localization/` (US spelling, **z**). A `localisation/` folder is ignored by the games and by PMT.

## File rules (all three games)

1. **UTF-8 with BOM.** Without the BOM the game skips the file. PMT’s IDE flags this.
2. Filename: `anything_l_<lang>.yml` — `l_` is a lowercase L, not the digit 1.
3. First line: `l_<lang>:` matching the filename (and usually the folder).
4. Each entry: one space, key, colon, optional version int, quoted string.

```yaml
l_english:
 my_event.1.t: "A Title"
 my_event.1.d: "Body text with a $other_key$."
```

Copy English files to other language folders (rename the suffix **and** the header) or other-language players see raw keys. PMT Health lists **untranslated** keys per language you pick in the heading.

## Override a vanilla key

Do not replace a whole vanilla loc file unless you must.

- **CK3:** `localization/replace/<lang>/` or `localization/<lang>/replace/` (replace-first path wins if both exist).
- **Vic3 / EU5:** `localization/<lang>/replace/`.
- **EU5** also nests loc under the stage folders (`main_menu`, `in_game`).

Keys outside `replace/` do not reliably override vanilla and may error. Loc files otherwise load **reverse ASCII** (Z→A); `replace/` is still the right tool.

## Formatting you will see in vanilla

- Reuse another key: `$other_key$`.
- Newline: `\n` (loc files only).
- Style: `#R red text#!` `#bold …#!` — start `#code`, end `#!`.
- Text icons: `@gold!` (defined in GUI font-icon files).
- Data functions: `[GetName]`, often PascalCase and dot-chained.

Every string shown to the player should be a **loc key**. Bare quoted text in script sometimes displays (events) and sometimes errors.

## What PMT does with loc

- The workspace **default loc language** is an IDE / hover setting (which language you read in tooltips).
- Health coverage lists **every language the mods ship**, not only the default: missing keys, orphans (loc with no script ref), untranslated.
- New Mod writes a stub file **with** the UTF-8 BOM.

See [Workspace Health]({{< relref "/pages/health" >}}) and the [FAQ]({{< relref "/faq" >}}) if loc is “ignored.”
