# Future Plans For Tool
1. Game Patch Diff Report (Multiple Views Supported):
   - Show File List on left and unified diff for each file on right
   - Show a "change highlights" list of all the larger changes to the game files with automatic links to the unified diff of the file (and line numbers)
2. Add New Tab for Mod compatibility Checker
   - Needs to support files of all kinds of names, so would either need to be user specified (worst, but easiest) or more likely sophisticated parse and memory of links/refs to different pieces of code across differently named files (best, but hardest)
3. Update merger script to support all entry types for merger (except whitespace and comments)
